# Parses a "buildFlags" file.
# Format is:
#   Lines beginning with a # are comments.
#   All other lines are build rules - "LEFT: RIGHT1 RIGHT2 ..." - if left is defined, then define right1 and right2...
#   If a build rule is encapsulated in [], e.g. "[LEFT]:", then this variable is internal and will not be
#   displayed in the GUI.
#   If a build rule is encapsulated in {}, e.g. "{LEFT}:", then this variable will be marked as 'advanced'.
#   '*' at the start of a line denotes a flag which is enabled by default.
