#summary Outlines the interface for all driver I/O

All drivers need to implement an I/O interface. This interface needs to support blocking and non-blocking calls for reading and writing data, and also allow software to read state information.

= Required Function Set =

All drivers must implement these calls:
  * read: the standard call to read data, should not block
  * readBlocking: blocking read call
  * write: the standard call to write data, should not block
  * writeBlocking: blocking write call
  * ioctl: permits control of the driver (setting flags and the like)

The following calls are optional, but should be implemented:
  * seek: POSIX-style seek

The following calls are up for discussion:
  * open: called to allow the driver to allocate resources for a new client to access
  * close: called to allow the driver to free resources

This is an inital mockup of ideas that should be discussed. Changes are likely to occur.
