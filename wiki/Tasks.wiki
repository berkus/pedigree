#summary Current task status

=Open=

  * Options/config system -- _Unassigned_
  * Refactor of path search algorithm -- _Unassigned_
  * String class should handle UTF8 properly, and all algorithms that currently operate on char*s should be ported. Also String should get some nice shiny new member functions (like operator== :/)
  * ~~Filesystem write support. -- [Matt], [JamesM], [Adam]~~
  * Ext2 driver should handle sparse files.
  * Kill tasks on page fault, not enter debugger. -- _Unassigned_
  * Generally improve the verbosity of error messages - catch 'em early. -- _Unassigned_
  * Add SSE/MMX support.
  * Add floating point support.

  * Ext2 cleanup.
  * VFS / file-syscalls.cc cleanup.
  * Get multicore up fully.
  * Refactor TUI into userspace - add IPC to that effect (via requestQueues). IDEA -- why not have a member function on requestQueue that will launch a request with one of the parameters as a shared memory space - give it a pointer and it'll copy it for you... Sounds appealing.
  * PPC needs shared libary loading - [JamesM]
  * x64 needs module loading, shared library loading, syscall managing, etc. - [JamesM], [Adam]
  * Permissions system -- [JamesM]
  * ~~Ext2 write support -- [JamesM]~~

=Assigned to Matt=
  * Routing tables -- [Matt]
  * ~~Loopback network device -- [Matt]~~
  * TCP retransmission queue (proper implementation) -- [Matt] -- *In progress*
  * ~~Sockets -- [Matt] or [JamesM] --~~
  * Signals -- [Matt]
  * ~~Complete FAT (file creation and deletion, tested writing) -- [Matt]~~
