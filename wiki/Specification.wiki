=Bootstrapper=



=Kernel-bootstrapper interface=

The final stage of the bootloader will be written in C++, meaning that information can be transferred to the kernel in a class form. The kernel therefore should not have to perform additional processing on any information given it to get it into a useable format.

The bootstrapper will pass a class containing:

  * this
  * this
  * and this.

=Registry=

The 'registry', for want of a better word, is a tree based structure, the leaf nodes of which are arrays key-value pairs.
