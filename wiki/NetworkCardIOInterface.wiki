#summary Outlines the interface for I/O in network cards

== Required Reading ==

See DriverInterface for information about the driver I/O interface.

== Interface Definition ==

Network device drivers should implement:
  * read: reads packets into a buffer, the count parameter states how many packets to read in, does not block
  * readBlocking: same as read, except blocks
  * write: writes packets from a buffer to the device, again, the count parameter states how many packets to write, does not block
  * writeBlocking: same as write, blocks
  * ioctl: should provide an interface to change at least the local IP and preferably the subnet and gateway addresses, also should permit modifying device modes (ie, promiscuous mode)
  * driverInit: probes for the device (either on the PCI bus or on ISA) and sets up local structures
  * driverDeInit: cleans up local structures and (optionally) resets the device
