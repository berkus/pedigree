#summary Definition of the interface between the kernel and the bootloader.

The bootloader shall pass the kernel a pointer to a structure, on the stack, as with the _cdecl calling convention. If the bootloader does a jmp to the kernel instead of a call, it will need to also push a dummy return value onto the stack so the parameter is in the correct place.
