#summary Outlines what is entailed by a context switch and how each architecture needs to implement it.

= Abstract =

I was thinking this through, and thought a wiki page would be a place to start so that I can get my ideas out without forgetting them. This page will (obviously) be updated as we go.

= Detail =

Each architecture provides a Processor::ContextSwitch implementation, which actually performs the stack switch. This allows the scheduler to be implemented in an abstract way across all architectures.

ContextSwitch takes two Thread objects as its parameters: one is the old thread, the other is the new thread.

Failure in ContextSwitch returns nothing, it only sets an ERROR log entry.
