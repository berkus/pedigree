#summary Build system documentation

=CMake=

The build system is currently being migrated to use CMake, the cross platform make. Don't be fooled - it's not a replacement for GNU Make - think of it more like an autoconf/automake that doesn't suck major balls.

==Obtaining==

I use some features of CMake which only appear in version 2.6. The current stable version is 2.4, so you'll have to compile from CVS for the moment. *You will need CMake 2.4 (or the latest stable) installed already in order to compile the CVS snapshot of CMake!*. Do this with `sudo apt-get install cmake` or something similar.

Run these commandzors:

{{{
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.cmake.org:/cvsroot/CMake login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.cmake.org:/cvsroot/CMake co CMake
mkdir tmp && cd CMake/tmp
cmake ../
make
sudo make install
}}}

Remember to close your terminal, as bash caches much stuff, so you won't see the new cmake straight away. Open a new terminal and run `cmake --version` - you should see 2.7 and a date string (today's date). Sweet - you're all running!

=Building=

Make yourself a temporary directory - builds in place are teh shits - and run ccmake for the curses-based option editor.

{{{
mkdir tmp && cd tmp
ccmake ../
make
}}}

Which should dump a floppy.img or similar file in tmp/.
